  <h3>About YFinanceDash</h3>
  <p>This demo app showcases how to use the <strong>yfinance</strong> Python package to fetch market data, company info, and corporate actions. It's a prototype intended for research and learning.
  </p>
  <p><em>Important:</em> yfinance uses public Yahoo Finance endpoints. For production trading applications you should use a commercial data provider and implement stronger error handling, authentication and rate-limiting safeguards.</p>
